Minutes from Previous Meeting
Last meeting was focused on getting us started on this sprint. We had roles assigned for certain deliverables, however, our progress was derailed due to a blocking issue between last scrum meeting and this one. The basic framework of the website is set up at this point on the customer side, and the plans moving forward are to start on the manager side. As of the last meeting, we had not yet encountered this blocking issue and thus were more focused on connecting our frontend to our backend, as well as polishing our existing UI and implementing a framew0rk for the manager and menu views.
