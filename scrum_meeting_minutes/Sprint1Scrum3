Minutes from Previous Meeting
Last meeting, we talked about the major blocking issue we were having with the database connectivity. Additionally, we also went through and delegated GUI tasks, since our initial plans were halted due to the database not being able to be connected. We brainstormed ideas to move forward, and then reviewed our progress thus far. Finally, we took inventory of what needed to be done before the retrospective is due, and assigned tasks for that.
