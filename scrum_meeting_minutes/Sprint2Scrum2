Minutes from Previous Meeting
Last meeting, we set up our initial roles for this sprint, and debriefed how sprint 1 went, as well as discussing how our team meeting went. We also each committed to a task that we would have done before the next scrum meeting, and figured out the smaller tasks we needed to complete to make progress towards our goal for sprint 2. Overall, we also discussed the effectiveness of the team this project, and why certain strategies were working better than others for successful completion of tasks on time.
