Minutes from Previous Meeting
Previous meeting, we finalize all of our deadlines for the 2nd sprint and completed some of our larger tasks we wanted to get done before the start of sprint 3. We all gave updated on our progress and redistributed tasks for the next sprint. Additionally, we updated the tasks that needed to be completed and added to task in terms of errors/bugs handling we encountered throughout the last sprint.
