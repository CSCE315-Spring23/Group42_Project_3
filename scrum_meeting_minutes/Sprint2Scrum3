Minutes from Previous Meeting
Previous meeting, we checked up on our status in the current sprint, and reaffirmed some ongoing, larger tasks that are still in progress.  Additionally, we restructured the distribution of tasks in the manager's view to better reflect their workload, and planned the remainder of the sprint in terms of tasks to be completed, and their distribution.
