Minutes from Previous Meeting
In the last meeting, we started planning out the work that needed to be done for our initial sprint, as well as writing out all of the tasks that would be needed over the course of the entire project. Once this was done, we started assigning tasks so that each individual group member would know what they had to get done over the course of this project. Because of various conflicts througout the week, it was determined that the workload would be largely pushed to this weekend. Finally, we had just completed our initial burndown charts, and figured out our pacing for this project.
